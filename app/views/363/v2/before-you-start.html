				Disclaimer
			</h3>
			This tool is designed to illustrate what your funds may look like based on the apprenticeships currently in your apprenticeship service account.<br>
			The actual amount of funds available is likely to vary if there are any changes made to your apprenticeship arrangements, including, for example:
			<ul class='govuk-list govuk-list--bullet'>
				<li>
					changes in the number of apprentices employed
				</li>
				<li>
					or the cost and duration of their training.
				</li>
				
			</ul>
			
			
			You should therefore not rely solely on the information provided by this tool when making decisions about how to spend future levy funds.
