                    <P class="govuk-body">During this iteration, I looked at different ways to implement the 'Check your answers' shortcut in this prototype. I've ended up with code for two different versions, which are stored in the following file in a new 'code snippets' folder:</p>
                         <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                              <li><a href="/public/code-snippets/if-statements-for-auth-pathing"
                                   class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">If statements for authorisation pathing</a></li>
                         </ul>
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                    <strong>Version 1</strong> does one big check. If the user answered all of the upcoming questions already, they skip to CYA. If they haven't, they go to the next question as normal.</li>
                    </p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                         <strong>Version 2</strong> checks each upcoming question in order. If it's not been answered yet, the user goes to its question page. If it has been answered, it gets skipped. If all questions have been answered you skip ahead to the CYA page.
                    </p>
                    <p class="govuk-body">
                         I also have a theoritcal <strong>Version 3</strong> in mind. This version would still check based on whether all of the upcoming questions have been answered, but rather than changing the actino of the 'Submit' button, it would instead add an additional button that takes the user to the CYA page. This would allow the user to more quickly change multiple answers, while keeping the ability to skip through to the CYA page when appropriate.
