        We need to check if you’ve proved your identity with GOV.UK One Login to give you access to your certificates and keep them safe. 
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        If you’ve already proved your identity, you can check your details on the next page.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        To prove your identity GOV.UK will ask you some questions and you’ll need:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
        <li>your passport</li>
        <li>your driving licence</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        or
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-list--spaced">
        <li>an equivalent photo ID</li>
      </ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Users without photo ID can instead use their UK bank account details and HMRC tax record to prove their identity.
